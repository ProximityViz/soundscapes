      <div class="item item-text-wrap">
        <p>The National Park Service formally recognizes soundscapes as a park resource.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"Natural and cultural sounds awaken the sense of awe that connects us to the splendor of national parks and have a powerful effect on our emotions, attitudes, and memories. Who can forget the flash of adrenaline from the sound of looming whitewater or the lightning bolt that cracked just a little too close? The National Park Service regards these sounds as part of a web of natural and cultural resources that must be protected."</blockquote>

        Measuring Sounds

        <p>Spectrograms show the rhythms of nature.</p>

        <p>Spectrograms display acoustic frequencies along the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. Colors are used to represent intensity, or decibel levels.</p>

        <p>Sound is measured in frequency and amplitude.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Frequency, often referred to as pitch, is the number of times per second that a sound pressure wave repeats itself. Units of frequency are called hertz (Hz). Humans with normal hearing can hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Dogs can hear sounds as high as 45,000 Hz.
          </li>
          <li>
            Amplitude, perceived as volume, is the relative strength of sound waves. Amplitude is measured in decibels (dB) which refer to the sound pressure intensity. Human hearing begins around 0 dB at 1,000 Hz. Moderate levels of sound are 60 dB. Loud sounds like vacuum cleaner begin at 70 dB. A very loud rock concert or jet engine may be around 125 dB.

        Defining Key Terms
      </div>
      <div class="item item-text-wrap">
        <p>The NPS Natural Sounds Program differentiates between physical sound sources and human perceptions of those sounds.</p>

        <p><span class="bold"><span class="emph">Acoustic resources</span> are physical sound sources,</span> including both natural sounds (wind, water, wildlife, vegetation) and cultural and historic sounds (battle reenactments, tribal ceremonies, quiet reverence).</p>

        <p><span class="bold"><span class="emph">Soundscape</span> can be defined as the human perception of those physical sound resources.</span> Like beauty, soundscapes are in the mind of the beholder. The rhetorical question about the tree that falls in the forest may help illustrate this. Because no human is there to hear it, the resulting crash is not a part of the human soundscape. It is however, a pretty significant part of the soundscape of the squirrel standing in the tree's path.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">The <span class="emph">acoustical environment</span> is the combination of <span class="emph">all</span> the acoustic resources within a given area.</span> This includes natural sounds and cultural sounds, as welll as non-natural human-caused sounds. The sound vibrations made by our imaginary falling tree are a part of the acoustical environment regardless of whether a human is there to perceive them. Bat echolocation calls, while outside of the realm of the human soundscape, are also part of the acoustical environment. One can understand, then, why it is critical to take the entire acoustical environment into account when working to protect natural sounds.</p>
